Hello from JWRR.  Using Jekyll for the 1st time instead of efefomatic. Not terribly impress yet.

Here is some Lua code:
{% highlight lua %}

function print_hi(name)
  if name == "Paul" then
    print("Hello, " .. name)
  else
    print("Hi, " .. name)
  end
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

The same Lua code can be written on a single line without semicolons.

{% highlight lua %}

function print_hi(name) if name == "Paul" then print("Hello, " .. name) else print("Hi, " .. name) end end print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
