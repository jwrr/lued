LUED Text Editor
================

Lued runs in the console like emacs and vim.  The goal is to be comfortable 
for Windows users.  Common Windows keystrokes are supported.  For example,
<kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> do copy, cut and paste, 
respectively. <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+Y</kbd> undo and redo. 
<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> save and quit. You move arrow using the 
arrow keys. PgUp, PgDn, Home and End work as expected. For more advanced 
commands, Lued attempts to be similar to [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
or [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  You can use the
mouse to copy and paste and the scroll wheel lets you easily navigate up
and down the document.
 
Lued is compatible with most xterms such as Konsole and Gnome Terminal. It also
works well with [PuTTy](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).
